# Jonathan Yin
👋 Hi, I’m @JonathanYin, a mathematics-computer science major with a minor in computer engineering at UC San Diego.

I'm passionate 💞 about creating software 👾 for a better future, and working alongside people with the same vision. In my free time, I enjoy weightlifting, running, and playing video games. 

Contact me at my [email](mailto:joyin@ucsd.edu)!
